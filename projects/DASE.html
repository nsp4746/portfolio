        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          DASE was my Master's project for my M.S. in Cybersecurity. The core
          focus was to create **dynamically generated scenarios** for incident
          response training. Unlike traditional static simulations, DASE adapts
          to the specific technology stack of a company, providing highly
          relevant and realistic training environments.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          The engine utilizes Company Profiles as input for a Large Language
          Model (LLM). The LLM interacts with the end-user to understand their
          training needs and then generates a bespoke attack scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the LLM is grounded in the specific company profile, it
          significantly reduces the risk of hallucination and ensures the
          generated content is technically accurate for that environment.
          Dynamic generation at runtime ensures that the scenarios are fresh and
          tailored, rather than using generic, pre-canned simulations.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamic Scenario Generation:</strong> Creates unique attack
            vectors based on real-time inputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Context-Aware:</strong> understands specific tech stacks to
            generate relevant threats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interactive Feedback:</strong> The LLM provides detailed
            feedback to users after the simulation concludes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Customizable Review:</strong> Users can select difficulty
            levels and the number of adversary actions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          As part of this project, I conducted extensive user testing surveys to
          refine the user experience. A thorough literature review was also
          performed to validate the methodology against current research in
          adversary simulation and automated training.
