    <h1>DASE: Dynamic Adversary Simulation Engine</h1>
    <p>
      This was my MS project for my M.S. in Cybersecurity. The focus was to
      create dynamically generated scenarios for incident reponse training. The
      way that it achieves this is by using company profiles that are fed into
      an LLM which then asks an end user what kind of attack/scenario they'd
      like to practice based on the companies tech stack. Due the LLM having
      this knowledge of company tech stack, it can create a scenario that is
      relevant to the company, additionally it reduces the risks of
      hallucination. This is because it is grounded to the profile. If we were
      to dynamically create companies at run time, it would not go over well for
      the design and end user experience. Additionally, the LLM is also
      instructed to provide feedback to end users once a session is over. A user
      can also select the amount of actions they'd like the simulated adversary
      to take as well as the difficutly, and between three different company
      profiles. As part of the project, I also conducted user-testing survey to
      understand where and how I can improve the project and user experience.
      Additionally, I also conducted a through literature review to find
      supporting works that supports my methodology.
