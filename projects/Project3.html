        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Worked with organization in Buffalo, NY to develop and implement a
          comprehensive cybersecurity awareness training program for employees.
          Also implemented policies and procedures for them to follow for the
          foreseeable future. This was through the Google Cybersecurity Clinic
          program.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          Challenges that were encountered were definitely working with a client
          in a project of this scope. It was my first time working with a client
          in this regard and it was challenging to get started. However, once we
          got started, it was a relatively smooth process.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Feature 1:</strong> Developed a comprehensive cybersecurity
            awareness training program for employees.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Feature 2:</strong> Implemented policies and procedures for
            false positives.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Results</h2>
        <p>
          The client was extremely satisfied with the results and was able to
          implement the policies and procedures for their organization.
