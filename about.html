        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Nikhil Patil. I am a recent graduate from the Rochester
          Institute of Technology with a degree in Cybersecurity. I graduated
          with both my B.S. and M.S. in Cybersecurity. In the vast world of
          Cybersecurity, I have dipped my toes into almost all facets, working
          with malware analysis, penetration testing, GRC roles, IT support
          roles. I am currently looking for my first full time role out of the
          college.
