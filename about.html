    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div class="about">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Nikhil Patil. I am a recent graduate from the Rochester
        Institute of Technology with a degree in Cybersecurity. I graduated with
        both my B.S. and M.S. in Cybersecurity. In the vast world of
        Cybersecurity, I have dipped my toes into almost all facets, working
        with malware analysis, penetration testing, GRC roles, IT support roles.
        I have yet to work at SOC or as an Security Engineer. I am currently
        looking for my first full time role out of the college.
      </p>

      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
      <p>
        In terms of professional experience, I have worked as an intern at Five
        Star Bank, where I was part of the Cybersecurity team. I worked
        primarily as an GRC intern. I completed a NYDFS Part 500 compliance gap
        review and other day to day tasks. I have also worked as an IT analyst
        intern at ComTec Solutions. Here I shadowed senior employees day to day
        and learned how the ins and outs of the MSP business, as well as working
        in my first white collar environment. I am used to working in a team
        environment, given that that I have worked in food service since I was
        16. Throughout my college career I have also maintained a position as
        Senior Staff at Campus Concessions, where I was in charge of regular
        staff and supervising student workers. Another leadership position I
        have was the president of the Rho Iota chapter of the Alpha Epsilon Pi
        fraternity. Here I learned much about working with individuals with
        different work ethics, backgrounds, and schedules. I am also a quick
        learner, and am always eager to learn new things.
